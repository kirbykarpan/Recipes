    <p>Hi! I'm Kirby (alias Korb, Kirb, or Kirbance).</p>
        <p>Since moving to Alaska 4 years ago, I've adopted what locals jokingly call an <em>"Alaskatarian" </em> diet. Essentially, I'm a dirty shoeless environmentalist who does her damndest to eat sustainable foods. Generally, that's vegetarianism. Sometimes, it's fish. And when I can get my hands on it -- hunted meat. At first, the diet felt restrictive, but now it seems there's not much at all I'm missing out on. Check out a few of my <strong>favorite recipes</strong> since adopting the Alaskatarian lifestyle.</p>
